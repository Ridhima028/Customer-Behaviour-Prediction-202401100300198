# Customer-Behaviour-Prediction-202401100300198

This project aims to classify customers as Bargain Hunters or Premium Buyers based on their purchase history. It uses a simple logistic regression model trained on customer behavior data such as total spending, average purchase amount, and visit frequency.

 Project Overview
Businesses can significantly benefit from understanding their customer segments. By categorizing users into bargain-focused or premium-oriented, they can:

Target promotions effectively

Customize offers

Improve customer satisfaction

This machine learning model helps automate that classification using basic behavioral metrics.

Features Used
total_spent: Total amount spent by the customer

avg_purchase_value: Average amount spent per purchase

visits_per_month: Number of visits per time period

buyer_type: Target label (0 for Bargain Hunter, 1 for Premium Buyer)

Technologies & Libraries
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn
